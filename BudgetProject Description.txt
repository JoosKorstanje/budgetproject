The aim of this project, that should be done by groups (4 or 5 students together), is to be able to
propose an analysis of the data contained in the file Budget.txt.
Those date concern the budget from 1872 to 1971 in France and you have the different spending :
• AN : year
• PVP : authorities
• AGR : agriculture
• CMI : trades and companies
• TRA : work
• LOG : accommodations
• EDU : education
• ACS : social action
• ANC : veterans
• DEF : defense
• DET : debt refund
• DIV : various
The individuals are the years.
The variables are the percent of the budget devoted to each category.
I would like that you focus on the analysis of the individuals and of the variables.
And I would like that you consider also the use of the FactoMineR package.
